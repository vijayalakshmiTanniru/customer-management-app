Tech Stack: React JS (including React Router), Node.js with Express.js, and SQLite
Objective:
The candidate must demonstrate proficiency in React JS (including React Router), Node.js with Express.js, and SQLite by completing assignments focused on implementing functional CRUD operations for the entities "Customer" and "Multiple Addresses." These assignments will require candidates to showcase their ability to implement efficient database management strategies and perform operations such as validation, error handling, and appropriate page navigation mechanisms.
Mobile CRUD Operations Assignments
Create a New Customer:
Validate input fields such as first name, last name, phone number, address details, city, state, and pin code before creating the customer record.
Display a success message after successfully creating the customer record.
Read Existing Customer Details:
Navigate to the customer's profile screen using the ID obtained from the database.
Display all details associated with the customer record in a clear and organized layout.
Update Customer Information:
Modify specific fields such as first name, last name, or mobile number as needed.
Display a confirmation message indicating successful updates.
Delete Customer Record:
Navigate to the customer list screen, search for the desired customer record by ID or other relevant parameters.
Confirm the deletion action before permanently removing the customer data.
View Available Multiple Addresses:
Implement a search functionality to locate customer records with multiple addresses.
List these addresses along with corresponding customer IDs.
Save Updated Multiple Address:
Modify address details while preserving the original customer ID association.
Update the multiple address through a server API call.
Mark Customer as Having Only One Address:
Select customer profiles where only one address is recorded and displayed as "Only One Address."
Invalidate this setting for customers with multiple addresses.
Search by City, State, or Pincode:
Implement search options to filter customer records by city, state, or zip code.
Display matching results alongside customer IDs.
Clear Filters:
Reset all applied filters during searches or address modifications, allowing unrestricted viewing of customer records.
Page Navigation:
Implement a paging system that allows users to navigate between pages containing different sets of customer data.
Include sorting options for efficient data retrieval.
Web CRUD Operations Assignments
Create New Customer:
Design a form with mandatory fields like First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Address Details, City, State, and Pin Code.
Perform client-side validation before submitting data to the server.
Handle server-side rules regarding duplicate IDs, email addresses, and account type availability.
Redirect to the customer dashboard upon successful validation.
Read Existing Customer Data:
Retrieve and present customer-related information such as orders, payment history, and shipping addresses using their unique identifier.
Display information in respective sections/tabs for clear organization.
Update Customer Information:
Facilitate the editing of customer details, including personal information, shipping, and billing addresses.
Ensure immediate updates across applications and provide instant feedback post-saving.
Delete Customer Record:
Identify the desired customer from the database and remove the record permanently.
Validate whether there are any linked transactions before proceeding with the deletion.
Provide proper confirmation messages throughout the process.
View Available Multiple Addresses:
Display all available multiple addresses linked to a single customer's record.
Provide filtering and sorting options based on attributes like Country, State, City, and Postal Code.
Allow the addition, editing, or deletion of addresses.
Save Updated Multiple Address:
Modify the status of multiple addresses dynamically and update them through server API calls.
Mark Customer as Having Only One Address:
Check if the customer has only one registered address and set a flag accordingly.
Display this information on the customer's profile view.
Search by City, State, or PIN:
Conduct full-text searches on customer names, addresses, emails, or phone numbers.
Display matching records with IDs highlighted.
Clear Filters:
Reset all search query parameters and previous filter settings, allowing for the complete viewing of customer lists.
Page Navigation:
Support infinite scrolling and provide options for sorting data in ascending or descending order.
Responsive Design:
Optimize the application design for compatibility across devices of varying screen sizes and resolutions using effective CSS media queries.
Error Handling & Logging System:
Establish a comprehensive error detection and reporting mechanism.
Capture errors occurring at every stage of CRUD operations and log them for troubleshooting.
Test Case Scenarios:
Write and execute test cases for each implemented function to ensure correctness.
Identify and rectify bugs to meet satisfactory performance standards.
Expectations
Candidates are expected to learn the specified tech stack—React JS (including React Router), Node.js with Express.js, and SQLite—thoroughly. They must demonstrate their understanding and implementation skills through the above-described assignments. The completed demo should clearly show their proficiency in the required technologies and their ability to handle complex CRUD operations in both mobile and web environments.
Once a sample solution is completed, they must record a video with the above functionality.
Candidates should create a GitHub Repository, upload the code, and give us access to Review the Code.
Once the code is reviewed, we will schedule an Interview Call with them.
